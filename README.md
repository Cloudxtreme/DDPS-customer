# DeIC DoS Protection Service (DDPS): Customer Site Simulation

This is a receipt for the installation of an _emby media server_ used as target
when conducting DDoS and DPS while developing the DeiC DDoS Protection system.

The repository contains documentation only. The documentation is written
in markdown and the file structure is based on [text bundle](textbundle.org)
skeleton except for the _json_ file - and the ``assets`` directory has been
populated with individual directories for images and CSS stylesheets.

  - Link to the [installation procedure](src/install_emby.md)

There is a generic Makefile for creating _html_ and _pdf_ from _Markdown_ files.
